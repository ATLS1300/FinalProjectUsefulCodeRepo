There's also code in this repo for solutions/tools many of you will find useful.
**dragBubbles.py** - example function to use for dragging. YOU MUST use the format shown in the function definition (ondrag(None) ... ondrag(func))
**setImage.py** - how to set the Screen and/or turtle as an imported image.
**img2gif.py** - converts images into a compatible filetype (.gif). FIX! It now allows shrinking (0.25, 0.5 scale values)
