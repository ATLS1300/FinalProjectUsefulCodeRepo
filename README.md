### Example Code:
There's also code in this repo for solutions/tools many of you will find useful.
- **soundFix.py** - YOU MUST FIRST INSTALL PYGAME by typing: `pip install pygame` in the command console of Spyder. Then, you can run the code to hear music and click to play sound effects. You MUST initialize the mixer to get sound to play. This is the 3rd line of code: `mixer.init()`
- **dragBubbles.py** - example function to use for dragging. YOU MUST use the format shown in the function definition (`ondrag(None)` `...` `ondrag(func)`)
- **setImage.py** - how to set the Screen and/or turtle as an imported image.
- **img2gif.py** - converts images into a compatible filetype (.gif). [FIXED! It now allows shrinking (0.25, 0.5 scale values)]
- **collisionBubbles.py** - getting turtles to bump into each other and change direction. Uses center positions, so collisions involve a little crossover of images. You'll have to tweak it to get it to bounce at shape edges.
- **turtleTextbox.py** - creates a clickable text box that writes, deletes and stores text entered into the box. Some editing is required to get it to work for all letters. Instructions are stated at the top of the script.
